# Music-Skill-Project        -Project-In-Progres-

This is a project. I created a skill that plays an audio file and allows you to control the Alexa playback functions via code.

Features:

* Easy to use and understand [Will add a step by step guide when is finished]

* Easy to customize.

* Simple design, perfect for a single stream, like a news flash, podcast or radio music.

* Offers the option to add images and text in devices with screen.

Known Issues:

In devices without screen, the skill is unable to save the track progress when you say pause.
